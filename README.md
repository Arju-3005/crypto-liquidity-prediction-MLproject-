# Cryptocurrency Liquidity Prediction for Market Stability
Machine Learning pipeline for predicting cryptocurrency market liquidity to support stability and risk management.
📌 Project Description

This project focuses on predicting cryptocurrency liquidity to ensure market stability. Liquidity indicates how easily assets can be bought or sold without major price changes. A lack of liquidity often leads to high volatility and instability.

We apply machine learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build predictive models to estimate liquidity trends.

🚀 Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Machine Learning model training and evaluation
Pipeline architecture for prediction workflow
Documentation with HLD, LLD, and Final Report
(Optional) Deployment using Streamlit/Flask API for live predictions
